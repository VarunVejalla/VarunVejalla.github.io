This placeholder project models your React + TypeScript tool that runs entirely in the browser.

## Deployment Pattern

- Keep source code in a dedicated repo.
- Deploy static assets and link the live demo.
- Optionally embed key interactions directly in this website.

This project is hosted separately and linked here so this portfolio repo stays lightweight.
